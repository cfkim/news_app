# LocalLink

A cross-platform app built with Flutter to bring communities closer together and end small-town boredom. Approximately **45 million** people in the U.S. alone live in non-major metropolitan areas. Typically, smaller towns offer less attractions than that of their larger counterparts. But having grown up in a small town myself, I've found that there's always something to do with a little searching and asking around! This app facilitates that hunt for fun while also letting you engage with other members of a community within one app. 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

If you haven't already set up Flutter on your device:

- [Flutter Installation Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

This app runs on IOS and Android. You can run this code on Android Studio, XCode, or VSCode. I recommend VSCode, as you can choose between running the devices with (> Flutter: Select Device) from one editor. At the moment the application hasn't been deployed, so it has to be run locally from your machine. Follow these steps to do this:

1. Clone this repo and open it in the editor
2. Select the device to run your simulation on (> Flutter: Select Device)
3. Go to Run > Start Debugging
4. Whichever device you chose will open and start building the project
